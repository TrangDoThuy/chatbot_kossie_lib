ChatBot is a Python module that provides a simple API for generating chatbot responses using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. With ChatBot, you can easily create a chatbot that can converse with users and generate summaries of conversations.

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use ChatBot to create a simple chatbot that converses with users:
```
import time
from chatbot_lib import ChatBot

bot = ChatBot()

while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    response = bot.chatbot_conversation(user_input)
    print("Bot:", response)
    time.sleep(30)
 ```
This code creates a ChatBot instance and uses it to generate responses to user input. The chatbot_conversation method takes a user input string and returns a response string generated by the chatbot.

You can also use ChatBot to generate a summary of a conversation:
```
from chatbot_lib import ChatBot

bot = ChatBot()

# Have a conversation...
# ...

summary = bot.chatbot_summary()
print("Summary:", summary)
```
This code creates a ChatBot instance and uses it to generate a summary of a conversation. The chatbot_summary method returns a string containing a summary of the conversation.

## Configuration
You can configure ChatBot by passing a JSON configuration file to the ChatBot constructor:

```
from chatbot import ChatBot

bot = ChatBot(config_file="config.json")
```
The configuration file should be a JSON file with the following structure:
```
{
    "initial_message": {
        "content": "Hello, how can I help you?"
    },
    "summary_prompt": {
        "content": "Can you summarize our conversation?"
    },
    "rate_limit": 20,
    "model_engine": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
}
```

The initial_message key specifies the initial message that the chatbot should send to the user. The summary_prompt key specifies the prompt that the chatbot should use when generating a conversation summary. The rate_limit key specifies the minimum number of seconds between chatbot API requests. The model_engine key specifies the GPT-3 model engine that the chatbot should use.
